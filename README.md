# Humane Tech Awareness Campaigns [![Humane Tech](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engagingspaces/awesome-humane-tech/master/humane-tech-badge.svg?sanitize=true)](https://github.com/engagingspaces/awesome-humane-tech)

[![Humane Tech Community](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-artwork/master/community-artwork/logos/humanetech-community-logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://humanetech.community)

This project is maintained by the [Humane Tech Community](https://community.humanetech.com). In this space our members collaborate to create (social) media campaigns that aim to inform the wider public on the problems that come with modern technology and the need to address these by applying Humane Technology. Of course, non-members can contribute just as well, though - if you are as concerned as us about the impact of technology on our society - we heartily invite you to join our community!

## Guidelines for new users

- First time on Github? Take your first steps by joining the discussions in so-called "Issues", or create your own issue to discuss any subject you deem important to discuss at the current stage. Meanwhile, under the "Code" tab, you will find all content and resources in a structured folder hierarchy. Before new content and resources are added, they are first discussed on the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/issues).
- When creating a new issue there are several types to choose from. Most issues will be of the type 'Regular issue', but to propose a new Theme, Campaign, or Deliverable, use a proposal issue. You can preview the issue templates here:
  - [Theme proposal](https://github.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/theme-proposal.md) - Propose a new theme for awareness campaigns ([raw text with comments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/theme-proposal.md))
  - [Campaign proposal](https://github.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/campaign-proposal.md) - Propose a new awareness campaign ([raw text with comments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/campaign-proposal.md))
  - [Video deliverable proposal](https://github.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/video-deliverable-proposal.md) - Propose a new deliverable for producing a video ([raw text with comments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanetech-community/humanetech-community-awareness/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/video-deliverable-proposal.md))
- We are continuously improving this space to make it easier for you to participate. If you have any feedback or ideas, or need help, do not hesitate, and create an issue, or discuss on our [community forum](https://community.humanetech.com) in an appropriate topic (topic links are referenced, where available).
- Issues will have many comments, where ideas and alternatives are proposed. A thread can become too long (TL;DR) really quick, so refrain from giving comments that do not add value, and when commenting keep your text terse and concise.
- It is important you let others know you agree :+1:, or disagree :-1:, or even love :heart: her/his comment or issue. To do this, you can select an emoticon from the top-right corner button of the comment. Use them in a serious manner to indicate intent, so they do not become meaningless!
- Be careful, when commenting, that you are on-topic to the issue at hand. If not, it is way better to create a new issue, and add a link to the original issue, plus the relevant quoted text. Github will then create a cross-reference automatically. (You can quote by prepending the quoted text with a `>` character per paragraph / new line. Use "Preview" to see how your formatting looks).
