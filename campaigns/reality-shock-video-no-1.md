# Reality Shock - Video #1 - Concept and Script

## Reminder: Campaign theme

The overarching theme of the campaign is to provoke and make people ponder the question: "Are you really comfortable with this?"

## Concept

“Let us look at how our pastimes have changed by considering a scene at a cafe that represents two decades. From leasurely and seemingly tranquil activities, we have become increasingly absorbed in our phones, in the process building the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world’s history. At the end, we realize our phone has become our only source of gratification.”

## Music 

First 2:37 of Beethoven’s Symphony 7 Movement 2 (“allegretto”). See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHxmAsINDk

This piece shows progression and increase in intensity, and is one of the most poignant and engaging pieces of music there is.

## Rough script

The whole scene takes place in one of these coffee place terraces you can see everywhere in Europe. This kind of place used to be cliche for spending time leasurely with friends, reading newspapers or a book, and watching people. The music starts slowly. Maybe only a few patrons (2 or 3, importantly most of them in their early twenties - see note below), all of them engaging in above-mentioned, "traditional" activities. Then as the music gathers pace and grows crescendo, more and more patrons of all ages and all backgrounds (students, business people, etc), alone of in groups, sit in, some of them picking up their phones and getting busy. The music grows louder, more and more patrons arrive, this time already holding their phones as they arrive. We start superimposing data (in the form of these high-tech transparent windows) pertaining to each patron that is relevant for harvesting, and showing growing profits, market caps for tech companies, etc. Once the music finally calms down in the very few seconds (just before 2:37), one person who was engrossed with his/her phone looks up from his/her screen, and realizes there is not a soul around. We can conclude with showing a message/question for the viewer on these few final notes.

## Dramatic effects

- We can think of many effects such as colors slowly fading into black and white, or turning black and white in the last few seconds. This would reverse the traditional effect of showing the past in black and white and the present/future in colors.

- Note also that I had initially wondered if the first few people in the cafe (those engaged in non-digital activities) should be older. On second thoughts, that would be a serious mistake, as it would make the whole thing a cross-generational issue (which would be a very naive stereotype). Thus most of these very first patrons should be young, probably in their early twenties. On the other hand, the crowd progressively arriving would be of all ages. On that issue, I note that smartphone addiction started BEFORE the first iPhone - seeing all these 40-year old or older businessmen stuck to their Blackberries at the time they became commonplace was already a shocker.
