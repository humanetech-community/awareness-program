## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

Argumentation, reasoning and "lectures" only go so far, hence the pressing need to first trigger an "emotional" response.

The campaign will feature short videos (2-3 minutes each) that aim to be dramatic and impactful through the combined use of words, cinematography and music.

It does not aim to explicitly pursue a specific agenda, push on the audience a clear message, or impose a "lecture". Rather, it aims to provoke introspection by telling provocative stories, the conclusions of which are left to the audience.

Why is it important to adopt a "neutral" approach based on providing factual observations in a spectacular and dramatic form? Because this campaign is based on the principle that we will not change our behaviors on the mere basis of facts and reason if we have no motivation to challenge our thinking in the first place and take a step back from our habits. The dramatic videos aim to shock and leave a strong impression that ideally will lead to wondering where each of us stands in all this.
