Dear [Name]:

**Re: Request for proposal to produce a short video commissioned by the Humane Tech Community**

The Humane Tech Community ("HTC"), founded by The Center for Humane Technology (www.humanetech.com), is a grassroots movement whose purpose is to "Re-align Technology with Humanity's Best Interests". Based upon four strategic pillars - namely, Cultural awakening, Political pressure, Engage employees, and Apply Humane Design - the community is actively involved in numerous initiatives aimed at changing the status quo and strengthening society.

One of these initiatives consists of structuring, organizing, and implementing several campaigns to raise public awareness of the potential pitfalls of rapid, drastic technology adoption and its significant impact on our society.

The first campaign, named _"Reality Shock"_, involves the production and distribution of a series of short, dramatic videos (each a few minutes long) aimed at shocking the audience into introspection and reflection on the hazards presented by technology (e.g., smartphone and social media addictions, privacy invasion, social credit systems, etc.) and how people may be negatively affected by these.

We believe that to achieve maximum distribution and impact, these videos should be produced by a professional studio. We would like to invite your company to submit a detailed proposal for the production of one of these videos, named _"Caffeine Injection"_ (working title).

HTC members will assess your proposal on the basis of your preliminary ideas, experience with similar projects, schedule, and budget. As you will understand, the HTC as a community of volunteers will pay special attention to the budget you propose. We hope that the final deliverable can be made at a reasonable cost, without sacrificing the high quality needed to reach a large audience.

If your company sympathizes with our cause, or believes, as we do, that this project has a high potential to be widely distributed and reach millions, we also invite you to consider working with us on a partnership basis, where you will essentially produce the video for free, in exchange for special credits and other advantages to be discussed. 

You will find attached the following information to help you prepare your proposal:

1. Campaign theme, description, and objectives
2. Video concept, script, and objectives
3. Scope of work
4. Key issues
5. Elements of your proposal

Should you have any questions about this project, please contact one of the following HTC representatives:

- Contact 1
- Contact 2
- Contact 3

We hope you will find this project as exciting as we do. It would be best if we could hear from you by November 30, 2019, but if more time is needed, please let us know.

Best regards,

## Attachment 1

### Campaign Theme: _Mankind 2.0_

Objective: Raising awareness of the impact of technology on our society by producing videos of unsettling or jarring experiences resulting from the conflict between promised, postive results and actual, negative results. Subjects to be covered in this campaign include smartphone and social media addiction, privacy invasion, and social-credit systems.

Approach

- Shock the audience without imposing an agenda or lecturing the target audience
- Lead to introspection and questioning by asking people if they are comfortable with the impact of these forms of technology on their lives
- Make the audience think and reach their own conclusions
- Provoke to reflect and reconsider

### "Reality Shock" Campaign 

Series of short, dramatic videos that illustrate the pervasive use of technology and rapid, drastic changes in our society and provoke people to ask, "Is this really acceptable in a healthy, fair, and strong society?"

Approach

Argumentation, reasoning, and "lectures" only go so far to change people's mind and behaviors; hence we propose to trigger an "emotional" response that leads to reflection. The campaign will feature short videos (2-3 minutes each) that aim to be dramatic and impactful through the combined use of words, cinematography, and music. It does not aim to pursue a specific agenda, impose on the audience a particular message, or impose a "lecture." Rather, it aims to provoke introspection by telling provocative stories, the conclusions of which are left to the audience. Why is it important to adopt a "neutral" approach based on providing factual observations in a spectacular and dramatic form? Our belief is that people will not change their behaviors on the mere basis of facts and reason if they have no motivation to challenge their thinking in the first place. The dramatic videos aim to shock and leave a strong impression that ideally will lead to reconsideration of our unconscious and pervasive use of technology.

### "Cafeine Injection" Deliverable

Short video depicting the rapid and drastic growth in smartphone addiction.

Objectives

- Shock the audience into realizing that our world has changed so much and so quickly since the smartphone's advent.
- Contrast previous times and social habits with the now universal addiction to our devices.
- Get the audience to ponder whether we should be more than a bit concerned about such drastic changes to the way we interact.

Concept

A look at how our pastimes have changed by considering a scene at a cafe that changes (in time lapse) over a period of two decades. From leisurely and seemingly tranquil activities, we have become increasingly absorbed in our phones - and in the process, are helping to build the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world’s history. At the end of the scene, viewers will, we hope, realize that smartphones have become their major source of gratification.

Script

The whole scene takes place in one of those coffee-place terraces common in Europe - a place that used to allow us to spend time leisurely with friends, read newspapers or a book, and watch people. Note: the terrace doesn't have to be in Europe.

Music begins: the first 2:37 mins. of Beethoven’s Symphony 7 Movement 2 (“allegretto”). There are only a few patrons (2 or 3 in their early twenties), all of them engaging in above-mentioned activities.

As the music gathers pace, more and more patrons of all ages and all backgrounds (students, business people, etc.), alone or in groups, come in, some of them picking up their phones and getting busy. The music grows louder, and more and more patrons arrive, already holding their phones. Data in the form of high-tech transparent windows appear, hovering over each patron and showing (1) info relevant for harvesting, and (2) growing profits, market caps for tech companies, etc. 

When the music softens in the last few seconds, one person who was engrossed in his/her phone looks up from his/her screen, and realizes there is not a soul around.

On the final notes of the music, we conclude with a question on the screen.

### Scope of work

#### Pre-production

1. Propose storyboard.
2. Suggest shooting locations.
3. Engage figurants and actors representing age groups 20 to 60.
4. To enhance video impact, propose cinematic effects in sync with music theme.
5. Suggest additions or revisions to the script.

#### Production

#### Post-production

1. Work with HTC on the producing the final product.

#### Key issues

- We want to create a slow and steady progression (accentuated by the music reaching crescendo). Hence it will be important to enhance the appeal of the video by incorporating cinematic effects.
- We want the video to have as neutral a tone as possible, while leading the audience to realize something is wrong about the rapid changes caused by technology. 

#### Elements of your proposal

- Introduction, confirming your understanding of our theme, concept, and the objectives of our campaign and proposed video. 
- Your preliminary views on key issues (see above), comments on the script, and ideas about cinematic effects.
- Possible shooting locations
- Your preliminary views on the availability of actors/figurants.
- Your shooting schedule
- Your rough budget (please avoid quoting a range)
