## Objectives

- Promote widespread adoption of new language terms designed to improve bad tech habits.

- Create an ongoing process of finding and launching new terminology and memes.

## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

Words have immense power. Language is our common medium and determines how we understand each other. Memes are like words, but then in the form of imagery that sticks to our mind. Together they can change our perception.

In this theme we'll execute campaigns to wield this power, to change minds and perceptions. To influence subconsciously. By strategically introducing and promoting both language and memes we will change how people look at their tech gadgets and the way they are using it.

The first campaign - and the proof-of-concept - promotes a term that already exists, in a way: The rise of the **Phone Zombie**.. the person that is standing next to you, yet is not really there. We will reinforce this term and the image that comes with it, so people will be ashamed when they are called that name, take care to avoid the risk of being perceived as one: a Phone Zombie.
