## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

This theme is based on the following principles:

- Not to push a certain agenda, or lecture the target audience
- Instead, provoke introspection and lead the audience to reach their own conclusions as to whether they are comfortable with the impact of such and such aspect of technology on their lives
- Acknowledge that we have become a very different society in a very short time and ask the question: _"Should we consider this more carefully?"_

## Strategy

<!-- (optional) If there is a common strategy, outline it here (one or more paragraphs of text, use formatting - like lists - where appropriate). Leave the placeholder text if this section is not needed. -->

- This theme does not require a high-level strategy. Strategies can be found on individual campaigns.
